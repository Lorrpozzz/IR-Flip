# IR-Flip

IR-Flip is a projekt written in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
It is basicly a soundboard that plays .wav files.
These files are designed so that when an IR-Blaster
(How to make one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD2c2DhlvuQ&t=2s )
is conected it will send Infared signals that can take control
of TV's LED's and pojektors.
